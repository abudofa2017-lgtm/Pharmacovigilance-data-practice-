# My First Pharmacovigilance Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This is my first step into applying data science to pharmacovigilance. As an intern pharmacist learning data science, I created this project to practice:
- Data manipulation with Python
- Basic statistical analysis
- Visualization of drug side effects data

## What This Project Does
1. **Creates sample drug safety data** for 5 different drugs
2. **Calculates side effect percentages** from patient reports
3. **Identifies the drug with the highest adverse event rate**
4. **Generates a visualization** comparing headache side effects

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Basic statistical analysis

## How to Run This Code
1. Open `drug_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to see the analysis
3. View the generated chart: `headache_side_effects.png`

## Why This Matters
This project represents my commitment to blending pharmacy expertise with data science. In real pharmacovigilance:
- We could analyze millions of reports instead of 5 sample drugs
- We could detect rare side effects using machine learning
- We could save lives by identifying safety signals earlier

## Next Steps
- Work with real adverse event reporting data
- Implement machine learning for signal detection
- Create interactive dashboards for healthcare professionals
